"""LibLibAI visible watermark detector/localizer.

LibLibAI (哩布哩布AI, USCC 91110105MACJ6K1C8A) stamps its generations with a
white triangle logo + "LibLibAI" latin wordmark at **bottom-center** (not a
corner -- the locate box is horizontally centered). Detection matches the
bundled font-rendered "LibLibAI" silhouette (the triangle logo is NOT rendered
-- logos vary, the wordmark discriminates); removal is the shared **localize ->
fill** (the glyph blob covers logo + wordmark, both bright).

This module supplies only LibLibAI's tuned :class:`TextMarkConfig`
(``assets/liblib_alpha.png`` from ``scripts/render_vendor_silhouettes.py``,
never cut from an upload).

Measured on the vendor cohort (15 TC260 carriers, harvested 2026-07-22 by
``scripts/vendor_cohort_harvest.py``), NOT inherited from Doubao:

  * The wordmark is ~0.10 of the frame WIDTH wide, centered horizontally, its
    baseline ~0.94-0.95 of the height; consistent across 768..2240-px frames.
  * The silhouette font is Arial, NOT the STHeiti the CJK marks use: the real
    wordmark is a grotesque, and measured across 7 candidate fonts Arial lifts
    the cohort positives from 0.31-0.47 to 0.42-0.73 while the full-corpus
    false arm (latin UI text) drops to max 0.398. A 200x200 icon false-fired
    at 0.444, so a per-mark size floor (``_MIN_SHORT_SIDE``) backs the gate.
  * Gate 0.42 (tophat front-end): false arm max 0.398, cohort 0.43-0.59.
  * STRICT ONLY (``provenance_ncc_factor`` 1.0): small cohort, the relaxed band
    is unmeasured.
