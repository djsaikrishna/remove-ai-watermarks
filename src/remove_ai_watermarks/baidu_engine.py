"""Baidu visible watermark detector/localizer.

Baidu stamps its generations with a white bold "百度" text run plus a separate
white rounded tag carrying dark "AI生成", bottom-right -- the China TC260
explicit AIGC label. Detection keys on the **百度 text run only**: a
two-component template (text + pill tag) was measured and REJECTED -- the solid
white pill is a bright-blob magnet and both front-ends scored the clean arm at
cohort levels (tophat clean p95 0.445 / gray clean p95 0.487 vs cohort ~0.5,
2026-07-22). The text-only silhouette separates cleanly (below). The white tag
is still removed with the mark: the fill blob covers both bright components in
the corner box.

Removal is the shared **localize -> fill** (:meth:`footprint_mask` ->
``region_eraser``). This module supplies only Baidu's tuned
:class:`TextMarkConfig` (``assets/baidu_alpha.png`` -- a font-rendered
synthetic silhouette from ``scripts/render_vendor_silhouettes.py``, never cut
from an upload).

Measured on the vendor cohort (16 TC260 carriers whose producer USCC
91110000802100433B names Baidu, harvested 2026-07-22 by
``scripts/vendor_cohort_harvest.py``), NOT inherited from Doubao:

  * The 百度 text run is 0.090 of the SHORT side wide (measured on 720/768/
    1024-px frames), with its right edge ~0.099 of short off the right edge
    (the pill tag sits between the text and the corner), bottom margin
    ~0.006; the locate box below covers the whole mark (text + tag).
  * Gate 0.43 (tophat front-end): on 278 hand-labelled clean frames
    (cohort-contamination-guarded) the max is 0.352 / p99 0.314, and the
    visibly-marked cohort frames score 0.386-0.65. Picked over the clean-arm
    0.37 after a full-corpus check on the 741-frame blind-labelled eval set
    surfaced 13 cross-fires at 0.38-0.43 (12 Qwen marks + one 抖音 mark) --
    see DETECT_NCC_THRESHOLD below. At 0.43 the cohort keeps 7 detections
    (0.61-0.65) and the whole 741 set fires only on the true Baidu frame.
  * STRICT ONLY (``provenance_ncc_factor`` 1.0): the cohort is small (16) and
    the sub-gate band is unmeasured, so no provenance relaxation exists.
